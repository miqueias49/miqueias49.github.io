    An Artificial Neural Network-based Stock Trading System Using Technical Analysis and Big Data Framework

    ABSTRACT
In this paper, a neural network-based stock price prediction and trading system using technical analysis indicators
is presented. The model developed first converts the financial time series data into a series of buy-sell-hold trigger signals using the most commonly preferred technical analysis
indicators. Then, a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) artificial
neural network (ANN) model is trained in the learning stage
on the daily stock prices between 1997 and 2007 for all of
the Dow30 stocks. Apache Spark big data framework is used
in the training stage. The trained model is then tested with
data from 2007 to 2017. The results indicate that by choosing the most appropriate technical indicators, the neural network model can achieve comparable results against the Buy
and Hold strategy in most of the cases. Furthermore, fine
tuning the technical indicators and/or optimization strategy
can enhance the overall trading performance.
